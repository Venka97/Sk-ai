This is my solution for Kaggle Ship Segmentation Challenge. (https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection). 
The model was trained on p2.8x instace from AWS. The model achived a Dice Coefficient of 0.783 on the dataset. Further optimization of the model was not done due to limited computation resources.
